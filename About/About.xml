A little special and valuable dish. At least for the Japanese.

It's less nutritious, but it cooks quickly and has a good temporary mood buff compared to other dishes.

Can make it using raw soybeans and raw rice as ingredients, but takes time to make.
[*][b]sushi wasabi paste[/b]
Can be prepared at the sushi counter table.
